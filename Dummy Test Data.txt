Here’s a table of buffer test data with plaintext, keys, and expected results for encryption/decryption. You can use these test cases for validating different encryption/decryption techniques.

Method	  Plaintext	Key	Expected Encrypted Output	Expected Decrypted Output

AES	      HelloWorld	MyAESKey	Encrypted (mock, depends on lib)	HelloWorld
RSA	      HelloRSA	  MyRSAKey	Encrypted (mock, depends on lib)	  HelloRSA
DES	      TestDES	    MyDESKey	Encrypted (mock, depends on lib)	    TestDES
Blowfish	BlowfishTest	BlowKey	Encrypted (mock, depends on lib)	BlowfishTest
Twofish	  TwofishData	TwoKey	Encrypted (mock, depends on lib)	  TwofishData
RC4	      RC4Message	RC4Key	Encrypted (mock, depends on lib)	  RC4Message
ChaCha20	ChaChaData	ChaChaKey	Encrypted (mock, depends on lib)	ChaChaData
Base64	  Base64String	None	QmFzZTY0U3RyaW5n	                  Base64String
XOR	      XORData	    XORKey	Encrypted XOR (binary result)	          XORData
Vigenère	VigenereCipher	VigenereKey	Encrypted(character shifts) VigenereCipher
